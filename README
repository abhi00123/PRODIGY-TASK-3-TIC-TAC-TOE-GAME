This code snippet represents a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes an HTML file with a game board, a current player's turn display, a restart button, and JavaScript code to handle player moves, check for wins or ties, and restart the game. The JavaScript code initializes variables, defines functions to handle clicks on squares, check for a win or tie, and restart the game, and adds event listeners to each square and the restart button.
